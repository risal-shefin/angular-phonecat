# Phone Catalog Tutorial Application
- This application is an experimental version of the main app that incorporates the co-existence of Angular JS and Angular. <br>
- In the [angular14-upgrade](https://github.com/risal-shefin/angularJS-phonecat-to-angular/tree/angular14-upgrade) branch, we integrated angular service, components, etc. into the project following [this](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade#phonecat-upgrade-tutorial) as the base guideline. <br>
- In the [gulp-to-webpack](https://github.com/risal-shefin/angularJS-phonecat-to-angular/tree/gulp-to-webpack) project, we integrated gulp into the project at first. After that, we performed the necessary transformations to incorporate raw Webpack and Angular CLI to build the whole project. In the meantime, we upgraded to Angular 17 as well. This branch is now merged into the master branch.
