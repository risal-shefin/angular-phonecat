# Phone Catalog Tutorial Application
- This application is an experimental version of the main app that incorporates the co-existence of Angular JS and Angular. <br>
- In the [angular14-upgrade](https://github.com/risal-shefin/angularJS-phonecat-to-angular/tree/angular14-upgrade) branch, we integrated angular service, components, etc. into the project. <br>
- In the [gulp-to-webpack](https://github.com/risal-shefin/angularJS-phonecat-to-angular/tree/gulp-to-webpack) project, we integrated gulp into the project at first. After that, we performed the necessary transformations to incorporate raw Webpack and Angular CLI to build the whole project.
